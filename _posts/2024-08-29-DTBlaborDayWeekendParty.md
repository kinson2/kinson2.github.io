Sorry not sorry for the last minute post! 

We're throwing a Labor Day Weekend Party on Saturday August 31, 2024 outdoors at Gallery Art Bar 6:00pm-10:00pm. Bring vinyl records to swap with like-minded audiophiles. Bring clothes to swap with friendly fashionistas. There will be vendors as well. Come out and play with us!

Spinning order will be Kamau KamauMau Grantham, Warren MIXZN Smith, Christopher CK Kinson, Stacey BLACKSTAR Robinson, and guest DJ Frostbyte.
