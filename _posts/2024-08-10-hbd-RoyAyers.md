On September 10 9:00pm-11:00pm indoors at Rose Bowl Tavern, I'm spinning the vibey tunes of the great Roy Ayers to celebrate his music and legacy. He's a creative tour de force and no one brings out the feel-good vibes like him. You're sure to hear the hits and rarities, maybe even a few songs he's influenced. It's going to be chill and fun. I might have a bday cake too. Come thru and relax for a bit.

Let me start by saying that I'm a lover of Roy Ayers music catalog. He is the epitome of vibes, as a world-class vibraphonist, and his music oozes soulful harmonies that make me dance and think at the same time.

He's had many bands including a Roy Ayers Quartet, Roy Ayers Music Project (RAMP), and Roy Ayers Ubiquity. RAMP's "Come Into Knowledge" album contains the oft-sampled "Daylight" Maybe you've heard of it...[Bonita Applebum](https://www.thefader.com/2015/10/13/rap-year-book-bonita-applebum-shea).

He produced Sylvia Striplin's debut album "Give Me Your Love". This is the album that with the beautifully funky tune "You Can't Turn Me Away" which has been sampled by Notorious BIG and Erykah Badu.

He's one of only a few Americans to tour and collaborate with [Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti](https://afropop.org/articles/roy-ayers-and-fela-kutis-2000-blacks-got-to-be-free-an-invitation-to-imagine-a-better-world).

[He's featured on GTA IV!](https://youtu.be/WUNq2a5zroA?si=kr1sLJ3x9m5H7EM7)

He made the soundtrack for the blaxpolitation film, Coffy, which stars Pam Grier. Need I say more.
