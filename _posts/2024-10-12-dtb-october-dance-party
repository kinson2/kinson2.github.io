On October 19 8:00pm-02:00am indoors at Gallery Art Bar will be Darker Than Blue's feature DJ event and dance party. 

I've invited my friend and DJ, Norman Hernandez of [kuumbaradio](https://www.instagram.com/kuumbaradio/), to open up for me 8pm-10pm. Check out his [SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/user-841755128?ref=clipboard&p=i&c=1&si=9840396AF57F414C9E1A7CA3DA9EFA71&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) with many of his archived mixes. 

Since it's my featured night, I am going to spin for the majority of the night until the bar closes 10pm-2am. I plan on playing a little bit of everything - R&B, jazz, funk, soul, and disco - and any of their subgenres and regional spinoffs. It's going to be a wild ride and I hope you are comfortable joining me on the journey and on the dance floor.
