Fela Fest is back and fresh as ever. In honor of Fela Kuti's up coming birthday, we wanted to play his music and celebrate African dance music in general including many genres: Afrobeat, Afrobeats, Afro house, Amapiano, Afro rock, Afro funk, gqom, etc.

This year's Fela Fest is October 11, 2024 at Gallery Art Bar! 

DJ KamauMau and I are spinning 8:00pm-12:00am. 

New this year, we have limited edition Fela Fest t-shirts for sale: one shirt for $15 or two shirts for $25. Contact me or anyone in the Darker Than Blue collective to purchase and receive your shirt.
