I'm spinning with my good friend and mentor [Stacey BLACKSTAR Robinson](https://www.staceyarobinson.com/) on Saturday July 27, 2024 at 10:00pm inside Gallery Art Bar in Urbana, IL. It's basically a Darker Than Blue affair since Warren Mixzn Smith is spinning outside at Gallery Art Bar at 8:00 pm. 

The music for our set Saturday night is hip-hop from 1973-1999. I'm sticking to this time frame very closely, even though I was born in 1988. 

DJ Kool Herc's party (the one with the infamous flyer) is from the year 1973. See this article in Essence Magazine by Okla Jones [https://www.essence.com/entertainment/the-block-party-where-hip-hop-was-born-1973/](https://www.essence.com/entertainment/the-block-party-where-hip-hop-was-born-1973/) as an example.

Many music writers believe the golden era of hip-hop ended in the 90s. See this paper by B. Duinker and D. Martin in the Empirical Musicology Review [https://emusicology.org/index.php/EMR/article/view/5410/4799](https://emusicology.org/index.php/EMR/article/view/5410/4799) as an example.
