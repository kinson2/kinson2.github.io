What a time to be alive?! 

On Thursday September 5 10:00pm-12:00am at Gallery Art Bar in Urbana, DJ E^Squared and I (both in the Darker Than Blue artist collective) are djing for the after party of the Flatlands Dance Film Festival. The Flatlands Dance Film Festival is directed by Laura Chiarmonte of the Univeristy of Illinois Dance Department. This year's feature film, Bad Like Brooklyn Dancehall, highlights the significance and influence of dancehall music in New York, Brooklyn specifically. One of the film's producers is Shaggy, the global reggae dancehall star with several hits including "It Wasn't Me", which samples WAR's Smile Happy. A wonderful addition to the festivities are master classes taught by dancer and instructor, Jevonnie "Jeo" Flemming.

Following the film is a panel with Assistant Professor Serouj Midus Aprahamian, Professor Special Advisor to the Chancellor for Arts Integration Dr. M. Cynthia Oliver, and Assistant Clinical Professor of Music Audio & Recording Technologies Lamont Holden.

And then... the after party, which is where you'll find me. We'll be spinning wicked tunes for the dutty winers and river ponders.
