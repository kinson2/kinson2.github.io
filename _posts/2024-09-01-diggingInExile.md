It's a busy month for Darker Than Blue.

We're crate digging at Exile on Main St. at 100 N Chestnut St in Chamaign, IL on Saturday September 7, 2024 2-7 pm. We're looking for dope records in store and will play them out on speakers for all to enjoy. Whatever records we play, you can buy at a discount price!
