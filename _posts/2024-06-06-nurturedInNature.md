I went out to Homer Lake in the spring for the Nurtured in Nature event organized by Tomas Delgado of [Healthy Champaign County](http://www.healthychampaigncounty.org/) and hosted by Tomas as well as Chevon Linear and Kameron Stanton of [Black People Outside](https://www.instagram.com/blk.people.outside/). They asked me a few questions about the importance of seeing BIPOC folks out in nature. Watch the video below.

The next Nurtured in Nature event is for summer at River Bend Forest Preserve in Mahomet, IL on Saturday June 22, 2024.
